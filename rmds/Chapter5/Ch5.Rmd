## Key Learning  Goals  

<font size = 6>

- Understand  why probability theory is the foundation for statistical reasoning.     

- Think addition upon hearing the word "OR"

- Think multiplication upon hearing the word "AND"

- Calculate probabilities of complex events by using standard rules of probability theory. 

- Use Bayes' theorem to translate between probabilistic statements.

## Samples and populations

<font size = 8> We do statistics to learn about the   

<font color = "LIGHTSALMON">World Out There (the population)</font>  



from


<font color = "STEELBLUE"> Data (the sample)</font> </font>

## Why Sample? 


<font size = 8> We almost never sample an entire population. So we canâ€™t nail down <font color = "LIGHTSALMON">parameters from populations</font>



But we can make an educated guess of parameters by making <font color = "STEELBLUE"> estimates from samples</font>

</font>



# <font size = 8 color = "LIGHTSALMON">Probability  Theory</font>

## <font size = 8 color = "LIGHTSALMON">Probability </font>

The <font size = 10, color = "LIGHTSALMON">probability</font>   of an event is its <font size = 10, color = "LIGHTSALMON">true relative frequency.</font>   

This is the proportion of times the event would occur if we repeated the same process over and over again.

## Probability allows us to connect


<font size = 8, color = "steelblue"> Sample estimates:</font>   

- Which we can obtain from data.  

- Which take their values by chance.      

<font size = 8,  color = "lightsalmon">     To Population Parameters: </font>     

- Which we can almost never obtain.     

- With values free from chance.

<font size = 10, color = "purple"> The probability distribution  of estimates from a sample of size n from a known population is among the most important probability distributions for statistics. </font>

# Probability Rules: 


# The addition principle 

<font color = "coral">[This OR That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9F5xcpjDMU)</font>


## General Addition Principle


$\large{P[A \text{ OR } B] = P[A] + P[B] - P[A \text{ AND } B]}$  

<br><br>    
 
<font size = 8> 
The probability of <font color = "black">A or B</font> equals  
The probability of <font color = "black">A</font>  
<font color = "blue">PLUS</font> the probability of <font color = "black">B</font>  
<font color = "red">MINUS</font> the probability of <font color = "black">A and B</font>  
</font>

## Special case of the addition principle 

<font size = 10, color = "black">Mutually exlusive events</font  >  

<font size = 10>If A and B are mutually exclusive</font>     

<br>  

$\large{P[A \text{ AND } B] = 0}$, so ...   

<br>


$\Large{ Pr[A \text{ OR } B] = Pr[A] + Pr[B]}$


## Example: Probability of a Range [1/2]

<font color = "darkred">The probability the sum of two dice is between six and eight.</font>   

$\large{P[ 6\leq }$`r ji("dice")` + `r ji("dice")`  $\large{ \leq 8] = P[6] + P[7] + P[8]}$


```{r, fig.height=4}

           prob    =  c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) / 36)%>% 
  mutate(my.col = outcome>5 & outcome < 9) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = outcome, y = prob, fill = my.col))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",show.legend = FALSE)+

## Example: Probability of a Range  [2/2]

<font color = "darkred">The probability the sum of two dice is between six and eight.</font>   

$\large{P[ 6\leq }$`r ji("dice")` + `r ji("dice")`  $\large{ \leq 8] = P[6] + P[7] + P[8]}$

           prob    =  c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5 + 6+ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) / 36)%>%

  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightgrey","lightblue"))+
  xlab(bquote(1^{st}~+~2^{nd}~roll))+

```



## Example: Probability of Not

<font color = "darkred">The probability the sum of two dice is not between six and eight.</font>   

Because  $1 = \Sigma$ (all posibilities), ...  $P[\text{not x}] = 1 - P[x]$

  mutate(my.col = (outcome == "6:8")) %>%

## Example: General Addition Principle

<font color = "darkred">Probability that the sum of two dice is  <font color ="red">odd or between 6 & 8</font>.</font>  

Subtract P[A & B] to avoid double counting nonexclusive events


$\large{P[A \text{ OR } B] = P[A] + P[B] - P[A \text{ AND } B]}$   

$P[\text{Odd OR  Between 6 & 8}]$ $= P[\text{Odd}] + P[\text{Between 6 & 8}] - P[\text{Odd AND Between 6 & 8}]$   




```{r, fig.height=2.25}

# General Multiplication Principle 

<font color = "coral">This AND that</font>

## The general multiplication principle 

The probability of A and B, equals the probability of one event times the probability of the second, conditioned on the first. 

$\Large{P[A \text{ & } B] = P[A] \times P[B|A]}$  


## Independence 

<font size = 6, color = "black">Two events are independent if the occurrence of one gives no information about whether the second will occur. </font>  

i.e. A & B are independent if   $P[B|A] = P[B]$

<br><br><br><br><br><br>     

<font size = 4, color = "red"> Note (in)dependence does not imply any mechanistic or causative relationship.  </font> 
 


## Probabilities for Independent Variables  

The Multiplication Principle <font color = "lightgrey"> (a special case of the general multiplication principle)


Remember the general multiplication principle: $P[A \text{ & } B] = P[A] \times P[B|A]$

If A & B are independent $P[B|A] = P[B]$   </font>    

Therefore, if A & B are independent: $P[A \text{ & } B]$ = $\Large{P[A \text{ & } B] = P[A] \times P[B]}$    

That is, if A & B are independent, the probability of A and B is the probability of A times the probability of B.  



  

## Mutually exclusive events

Are they independent, ?

## Example: Oguchi disease


*"Oguchi disease, also called congenital stationary night blindness, Oguchi type 1 or Oguchi disease 1, is an <font color = "black">autosomal recessive</font> form of congenital stationary night blindness associated with fundus discoloration and abnormally slow dark adaptation."* 

- from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oguchi_disease 

<br><br>  <br><br>  <br><br>   

<font size= 5>Since Oguchi disease is <font color = "black">autosomal recessive</font>, it is only expressed if an individual inherits both the mutant allele from mom and from dad. </font>  

## Child of two Oguchi carriers  

<font color = "darkred"> If both of parents have an affected chromosome but no disease, what's the probability that a given child will have Oguchi disease?</font>   

Remember: A child gets Oguchi disease by inheriting <font color = "black">two affected</font> chromosomes.   
  
A child has a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance of inheriting mom's affected chromosome <font size = 6, color = "black">AND</font> a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance of inheriting dad's affected chromosome.  

So, the probability that a given child of heterozygotes has the disease = $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$.

# Working through probability logic with probability trees

## Probability Trees

Probability theory can be hard, logic is straightforward.  

Being explicit about what you're doing makes this easier.

Probability trees offer a simple way to follow your accounting.

# Conditional probabilities 

## Conditional probability 

The conditional probability of an event is the probability of that event occurring given that a condition is met. 


$\Huge{P[X|Y]}$ (**read "|" as ***given***.**)

$P[X | Y]$ means the probability of X if Y is true.

<br><br>  

Pr(Survive Titanic | Adult in 1st class) = 0.62.

## Law of total probability 

$\huge{ P[X] = \Sigma(  P[X | Y ]  \times P[Y])}$


Summing over all Ys

The probability of surviving the Titanic is

P[survive] =  

- P[survive | 1st class] P[1st class] +   
P[survive | Not 1st class] P[Not 1st class]  

- = $0.62 \times 0.15 + 0.35 \times 0.85 =0.39$   



# Short Summary: Addition and Multiplication Principles

## Short Summary: Addition Principle

The probability of A **OR** B involves addition.

$P[A \text{ or } B] = P[A] + P[B] -  P[A  \text{ & } B]$

- if the two are mutually exclusive, $P[A  \text{ & } B] = 0$, and therefore 
$P[A \text{ or } B] = P[A] + P[B]$ 


## Short Summary: Multiplication Principle

The probability of A **AND** B involves multiplication

- $P[A \text{ and } B] = P[A] \times P[B|A]$  

This becomes $P[A \text{ and } B] = P[A] \times P[B]$ if the two are independent (i.e. $P[B|A] = P[B]$)


# Bayes' Theorem   



## Bayes' Theorem: Definition 

The probability of  A given  B equals the probability of B given A times the probability of A divided by the probability of B. 

$$\huge{P[A|B] = \frac{P[B|A]\times P[A]}{P[B]}}$$



## Bayes' Theorem: Derivation:    

<font color = "black">we know</font> $P[A \& B] = P[B] \times P[A|B]$   AND THAT  
$P[A \& B] = P[A] \times P[B|A]$  

<font color = "black">Clearly,</font> $P[A \& B] = P[A \& B]$... so $P[B] \times P[A|B] =  P[A] \times P[B|A]$  

<font color = "black">Divide both sides by P[B] to find</font>   $P[A|B] = \frac{P[B|A]\times P[A]}{P[B]}$

##  Bayes' Theorem: Titanic Example

<font color = "darkred">What's the prob. that an adult survivor was in 1st class?</font>  


INFO  
319 of the 2092 adults on the Titanic where in 1st class.     
197 of the 319 adults in 1st class survived.   
457 of the 1316 other adults survived. 


$P[\text{1st class | survive}]$  

$= P[\text{survive | 1st class}] \times P[\text{1st class}]  / P[\text{survive}]$     

$= \frac{(197 / 319) \times (319 / 2092)}{(197+457)/2092} = .30$

<br>

<font size = 4>Reassuringly, this equals the number of adult survivors in 1st class divided by the number of adult survivors = 
 197 / (197 + 457) = .30</font>

## Probability wrap up 

Probability theory provides a foundation for rigorous statistics. 

Application of simple rules of probability facilitates the generation of more complex  predictions. 


We can use Bayes' Theorem to translate between different forms of probabilistic statement, allowing for example, for the clearer communication of risk.
